# instances
The package to manage instances for my reseach problem.

## How to use it

Make sure you have python >= 3.6, then save the output of the models to a file. To load a lp in CPLEX, optimize and display the solution:

```
r file_name.lp
o
dis sol var -
```

Some of the models require `numpy`.
