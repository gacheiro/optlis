# optlis
Code for the project _Logistique d'Intervention suite aux catastrophes industrielles_
developed at the LITIS lab, UniversitÃ© Le Havre Normandie.

## Requirements
To use this package you will need gcc, python >= 3.8 and CPLEX previously installed in your system.

## Installation
Once you are inside the project folder, start by building the C code:

```bash
make
```

And export the `lib` directory as an environment variable using the absolute path:

```bash
export OPTLIS_LIB=path/to/optlis/lib
```

It is highly recommended to install this package inside a [virtual environment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/).

Once you have downloaded or cloned the repository, install it by using (make sure you are inside a virtual environment if you opted to use it):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To verify that the installation worked, test it by using:

```bash
pytest
```

You will also have to manually install CPLEX python interface if you want to run the integer models.

## Usage
Generate the instance benchmark:

```bash
invoke export-benchmark path/to/inst-dir/
```

Solve the instance benchmark:

```bash
invoke --help bulk-solve # Display help

invoke bulk-solve [solver] path/to/inst-dir/ -o path/to/sol-dir -l path/to/log-dir -t `[time limit]` # static problem
invoke bulk-solve [solver] -d path/to/inst-dir/ -o path/to/sol-dir -l path/to/log-dir -t `[evaluations]` # dynamic problem
```

Replace `[solver]` by `cplex` or `ils` and define a `[time limit]` for cplex (in seconds) or a max number of evaluation calls for ils.
For the moment, bulk solving the dynamic problem with ils is not supported.
